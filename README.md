# Weather ETL Pipeline in Databricks

This repository contains code and documentation for an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that retrieves weather data from an API and performs necessary transformations before loading it into a data storage system using Databricks.

## Overview

The Weather Data API ETL is designed to retrieve weather data from a specified API, transform it into a desired format, and load it into a data storage system. This process can be used to gather historical weather data, real-time weather updates, or any other weather-related information available through the API.

The ETL process is implemented using Databricks, a cloud-based analytics and data processing platform. Databricks provides a powerful environment for running distributed data processing tasks using Apache Spark, which is leveraged for data extraction, transformation, and loading.

## Setup

To use the Weather Data API ETL, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or Databricks workspace.
2. Set up a Databricks cluster with the necessary runtime and configurations.
3. Ensure that you have the required access credentials or API keys for the weather data API you wish to use.
4. Install any necessary dependencies or libraries, such as the requests library for making HTTP requests.
5. Update the configuration files and scripts in this repository according to your specific requirements. This may include modifying the API endpoint, authentication headers, data transformation logic, and destination storage details.
6. Upload the modified scripts and configuration files to your Databricks workspace or run them directly on your local machine.
7. Execute the ETL process by running the main script or notebook. Monitor the progress and check for any error messages or log outputs.
8. Once the ETL process completes successfully, verify that the weather data has been loaded into the specified data storage system.
